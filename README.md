# BrickFort

*BrickFort* is an attempt at implementing a "Procedural Castle" as proposed by the Second Monthly Challenge on /r/proceduralgeneration

https://www.reddit.com/r/proceduralgeneration/comments/3zy53l/monthly_challenge_2_jan_2016_procedural_castle/

There will be no interactive demo this time, because the system is not web-based.
